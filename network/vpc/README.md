# AWS - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

## When to use VPC

* To connect to build data in an Amazon RDS
* Query data in an Amazon ElastiCache cluster directly from tests
* Interact with internal web services
* Retrieve dependencies from an internal repo like custom PyPi
* Access Amazon S3 to allow access through Amazon VPC only
* Query external web services that require a fixed IP

## Creating a VPC

Tutorial: [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Tutorials.WebServerDB.CreateVPC.html)

## Subnets

### Public Subnets

A Subnet **with** a routing table that has routes to an Internet Gateway (IGW)

#### Routing table info

Subnet route table to IGW:

* IPv4: `0.0.0.0/0`
* IPv6: `::/0`

### Private Subnets

A Subnet with**out** a routing table that contains routes to an IGW

### Routing tables

* select subnet
* click routing tab
* routing table is above the actual table:
  * **Routing Table:** `rtb-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

## NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance

Main Point: NAT Instance can be used as `Bastion Server`

## NAT vs IGW

* IGW: lets instances with public IPs access the internet
* NAT: lets private instances access the internet
  * this is more for like updating software and whatnot

## Security Groups

Find your IP: [https://checkip.amazonaws.com/](https://checkip.amazonaws.com/)

## Elastic IP

Need this to actually connect to public subnet
